Generic functions are valuable because they allow you to define a general algorithm that
can be applied to various types of data. (That is, specific versions of the algorithm need
not be explicitly created by you.) Generic functions further help implement the concept
of ”one interface, multiple methods,” which is a common theme in C++ programming.
