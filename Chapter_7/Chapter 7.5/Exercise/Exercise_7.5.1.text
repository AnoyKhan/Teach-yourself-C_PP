Explain why a virtual base class might be necessary

-A virtual base class is needed when a derived class inherits two (or more) classes, both of
 which are derived from the same base class. Without virtual base classes, two (or more)
 copies of the common base class would exist in the final derived class, However, if the
 original base is virtual, only one copy is present in the final derived class.
