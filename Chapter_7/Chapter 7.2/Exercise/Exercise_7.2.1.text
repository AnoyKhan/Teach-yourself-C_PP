1. What happens when a protected member is inherited as public? What happens when it
   is inherited as private? What happens when it is inherited as protected?

Ans- When a protected member of a base class is inherited as public, it becomes a protected
     member of the derived class. If it is inherited as private, it becomes a private member of
     the derived class. If it is inherited as protected, it becomes a protected member of the
     derived class.
